== Overview

A solution to build the necessary infrastucture on OpenStack for Multi Tier App.

This is, today, monolithic in that the `tok.openstack` collection is *currently` embedded inside the repo.


[NOTE]
====
The server component is an empty collection role
=== Notes

* defaults to run from remote control node 
** To run locally on workstation just change inventory so it is localhost

=== Three playbooks

* `deploy-all.yml`
** Full deploy from zero to running app
* `deploy-openstack-three-tier-infra.yml`
** Builds Infrastructure including instances but no app
* `deploy-three-tier-app.yml` Requires existing infra (previous play), generates inventory, deploys app
